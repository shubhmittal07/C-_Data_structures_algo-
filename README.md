#Vector Notes

1)Syntax-> std::vector<type> name;

2)Object type reference .vs. Pointer type reference---->

Basically objecy type veertex is more optimal as it store data in line,

as compared to pointer type data, which scatters data on heap,

which makes it a bit slow for iterating through the vertex.
